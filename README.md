## ❔ What's this about?

FastPoke is a solution for poke restaurants that make ordering faster and more intuitive.

It has been designed to use it in ordering kiosks, like the ones you see in fast food restaurant chains. Customers make their orders in the touchscreen, having all the resturant menu options at hand.

This is a practice project I've made to dive deep in Angular and Nest. It is extensible and there are many upgrades I have planned for it.
